# Set is an unordered collection with no duplicate entries
# Keys of a dictionary are similar to a set, since Python 3.7, keys in dictionary are ordered.
# No way to access individual items on a set
# Most common operation we can perform on set is to test for membership. (in -> membership operator)
# Union of 2 or more sets, is the set of all items that exist in all the sets ( set1.union(set2) )( set1 | set2 )
# Elements after union appear only once. As per definition of set, items must be unique.
# Intersection of 2 or more sets is the set of items that appear in all sets ( set1.intersection(set2) )( set1 & set2 )
# Subtract one set from another (set1 - set2) ( set1.difference(set2) )
# Set theory also defines symmetric difference, set of items that are in 1 set or another but not in both, it's the
# opposite of intersection of 2 or more sets ( set1.symmetric_difference(set2) ) ( set1 ^ set2 )
# One set can be a subset of another set, normal comparison operators, <, <=, >, >= to check for subsets
